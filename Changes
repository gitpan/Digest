   Release 1.03

   Added add_bits() method as requested by the
   Digest::SHA author Mark Shelor.

   Added Digest::base class that Digest implementations
   can use to get default implementations of addfile(),
   add_bits(), hexdigest() and b64digest().

   Digest->new("SHA-256") and similar should work now
   given that you have either Digest::SHA or Digest::SHA2
   installed.
